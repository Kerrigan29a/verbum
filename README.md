## Introduction
This project is based on the main idea that appears in [an article about how Gauss malware encrypts his payload](http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208193781/The_Mystery_of_the_Encrypted_Gauss_Payload) ([more](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/03/the-worlds-most-mysterious-potentially-destructive-malware-is-not-stuxnet/)). With Verbum, you can encrypt some desired parts of an executable file and decrypt them in an explicit way when it's necessary without storing the password inside the executable itself (obviously you have to provide the password in any way to the process when necessary). Verbum it's a proof of concept and is not intended to replace standard packers and crypters.

The design of Verbum tries to uncouple as much as possible the code related to the ciphering capabilities from the rest of the code.

## Usage
To include Verbum in your project you have to do the following steps:
1. Compile Verbum
2. Include  the scripts in the configuration of the target project.
3. Include your code to decrypt the payload.
4. Create an empty Verbum configuration file. Due to the way in wich Verbum works ([x-macros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Macro)), its necessary to generate a line for each target block with "dummy" addresses, to fill them later.

```
$ cat verbum.conf
# Format:
#     symbol:start_addrs:stop_addrs:passwd
#
# Addresses must be absolute
# start_addrs must be greater than stop_addrs

# Foo module
foo:0x0000000100000000:0x0000000100000001:gauss
# Bar module
bar:0x0000000100000000:0x0000000100000001:gauss
```

5. Compile your project with debug symbols and without crypt.

```
make NO_STRIP=1 NO_CRYPT=1
```

6. Examine and extract the addresses of the blocks you want to protect.

```
$ nm -g -n  -a example
                 U ___bzero
                 U ___stack_chk_fail
                 U ___stack_chk_guard
                 U ___stderrp
                 U _exit
                 U _free
                 U _fwrite
                 U _getpagesize
                 U _malloc
                 U _memcpy
                 U _mprotect
                 U _perror
                 U _printf
                 U _puts
                 U _signal
                 U _strcpy
                 U _strlen
                 U _strncasecmp
                 U dyld_stub_binder

00000001000030f8 S ___progname
0000000100003100 S _txt
```

7. Update the addresses in the configuration file

```
$ cat verbum.conf
# Format:
#     symbol:start_addrss:stop_addrss:passwd

# Foo module
foo:0x00000001000018a0:0x0000000100001910:gauss
# Bar module
bar:0x0000000100001910:0x0000000100001930:gauss
```

7. Clean all the automatically generated files.
8. Compile again the target project to generate the crypted executables.
9. You can strip the executable.
10. Test the final executable. The first time (when you fill the configuration with dummy addresses) could fail and don't decrypt correctly the payloads. This is caused due to some issues related with x-macros. To solve this, jump again to the step 5 and update again the addresses. In one or two iterations, the problem should be solved.

For more information, see the example project.

# Configuration
Inside Verbum folder you can find `config.h`:

```c
#ifndef __CONFIG_H__
#define __CONFIG_H__

/*
 * Number of iterations to apply on Key Stretching
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching
 */
#define HASH_ITERATIONS 1000000

/* The device used to get random bytes */
#define RANDOM_DEV "/dev/random"

/* The length of the salt */
#define SALT_LEN 16

#endif /* __CONFIG_H__ */
```

You can also change some parameter on Makefiles. By default is used Clang instead of GCC.

## Todo
- Windows port.
- Improve documentation.
- Use in big project to test stability.
- Search for a better and automatic way to generate the configuration file.
